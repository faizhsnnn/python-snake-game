---
A classic Snake Game built using Python’s Turtle graphics module. Developed as part of my #90DaysOfCode challenge, this project focuses on applying object-oriented programming, event-driven input handling, collision detection, and real-time game logic to build an interactive graphical game.

# 🚀 Features

🐍 Classic snake movement with segment-following logic

🎮 Keyboard controls with direction validation

🍎 Random food generation and snake growth

📊 Real-time score tracking

💥 Collision detection (wall & self)

🧠 Object-oriented design using multiple classes

⚡ Smooth animation using screen tracer optimization

🧼 Clean, readable, beginner-friendly code structure

# 🛠 Installation & Running the Game

1️⃣ Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/faizhsnnn/python-snake-game.git
cd python-snake-game
```

2️⃣ Run the game
```
python main.py
```
🖥 A turtle window will open.

Use arrow keys to control the snake.

The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
